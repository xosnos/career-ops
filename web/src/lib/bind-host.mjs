// bind-host.mjs — what interface the dashboard listens on, and the argv that says so.
//
// The socket is the dashboard's outermost access control. `next dev` /
// `next start` with no -H reach server.listen(port, undefined), which binds every
// interface, and the request guard cannot compensate: Host is chosen by the
// client, so a LAN caller spelling `Host: localhost` satisfies it. See
// origin-guard.mjs's header for the full threat model — this module owns only the
// bind half of it, and the bind is not the whole of it.
//
// Kept out of origin-guard.mjs, which is per-request decision logic pinned to
// the edge runtime. Both read CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS through the same
// parseAllowedHosts, so neither can widen on that variable without the other.
//
// That is the limit of the guarantee, and the two layers do diverge elsewhere:
// a caller's own -H moves the bind with the allow-list untouched, and a fallback
// bind of 0.0.0.0 is IPv4-only, so an opted-in IPv6 host passes the filter with
// nothing listening for it. planNextRun reports the first; the README documents
// both.
//
// Pure in the sense that matters: no process state, no I/O. server.mjs passes
// the environment in and acts on what comes back, so the whole decision is
// testable on values rather than inferred from the launcher's source text.
//
// It does import node:net for isIP. Only server.mjs and the tests import this
// module — proxy.ts imports origin-guard.mjs, which stays free of node imports
// for the edge runtime — so the dependency costs nothing here, and hand-rolling
// an address parser instead proved to be exactly the wrong trade: the version
// that counted colons admitted `2001:db8:1` as a bind target.
