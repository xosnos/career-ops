// Single choke point over everything the dashboard serves. Every request is
// gated on the same-origin + loopback guard before it can reach a route handler
// (which may spawn a child process or write the user's files) or a page (which
// renders the user's CV, pipeline and reports). See origin-guard.mjs for the
// two-layer rationale (F1 drive-by CSRF, F2 LAN reachability).
//
// Opt in to extra hosts (e.g. a trusted LAN box) with a comma/space separated
// CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS; unset means loopback only.
//
// Opt in to extra *origins* the same way with CAREER_OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS;
// unset means none, which is the default and leaves the guard as strict as it
// was. It is what a local companion client needs: a browser extension calls
// from a chrome-extension:// origin, which Fetch Metadata always reports as
// "cross-site", so every one of its requests is refused otherwise.

// Everything except build assets. Scoping this to /api left every page route
// ungated, which loopback does not cover: a page that re-resolves its own domain
// to 127.0.0.1 (DNS rebinding) fetches /pipeline same-origin from the user's own
// browser, and force-dynamic pages read the tracker off disk on each request.
// The Host header carries the attacker's domain there, so the guard refuses it —
// but only if it runs. Build assets stay out: they are the same for every user,
// carry nothing of theirs, and a caller who cannot read a page has no use for
// the chunk that renders it.
