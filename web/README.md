# career-ops web (alpha)

An **experimental, opt-in web UI** for career-ops. It is a local-first *view* over
the exact same files the CLI reads and writes (`data/pipeline.md`,
`data/applications.md`, `reports/`, `config/`): no parallel engine, no separate
database, no server. If you never run it, nothing about your CLI workflow changes.

> roadmap context → [Discussion #156](https://github.com/career-ops-hq/career-ops/discussions/156).

## Quick start

Requires Node 22.6+ (see [Tests](#tests) — `npm test` needs glob discovery, and `--experimental-strip-types` for the suites that import `.ts` modules directly; the flag landed in 22.6.0).

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The app reads the career-ops checkout it lives in
(the parent directory) — your existing CV, pipeline and reports appear as-is.

The server binds IPv4 loopback, so reach it as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`;
`http://[::1]:3000` has nothing listening on it.

## What works today

- **Pipeline** — your tracker as a sortable, filterable table; status changes
  write back through the core's own scripts.
- **Explore** — the free reverse-ATS scan with an honest partial-dataset
  indicator, plus AI-assisted discovery (bring your own CLI/keys, including Grok Build CLI).
- **Scheduled scans** — save local zero-token or full-dataset scans and run due
  jobs through an optional Windows Task Scheduler worker.
- **Apply** — assisted form prefill with a hard rule inherited from the core:
  **it never submits for you** — you always press the button.
- **Today / Analytics / CV / Config** — action queue, funnel + pipeline Sankey,
  CV editing with preview, settings.

## Safety

- **Local-first:** the local web app runs entirely on your machine — no cloud,
  no account needed. Your CV and data stay in your own files.
- **Loopback by default:** `npm run dev` and `npm start` bind `127.0.0.1`, so
  nothing else on your network can reach the dashboard. It has no login — the
  bind is the access control. Opt out deliberately with
  `CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` ([below](#exposing-it-beyond-this-machine)).
- **Never auto-submits:** the apply flow drafts and prefills; submitting is
  always a human action.
- **CV generation never asks the agent to write:** the `pdf` worker tailors your
  CV and emits it inline in a `<<cv-html>>` envelope; the backend parses that
  envelope, writes the HTML, and renders the PDF itself. Job postings and
  evaluation reports are untrusted input that reaches this agent, so the safest
  thing is for it to hold no write tool at all — on Claude Code every write-capable
  tool is disallowed for this mode (`Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`
  and `Bash`). Other CLIs are invoked with a bare prompt and keep their own default
  tool access, so on those the agent still *holds* write tools — what the pipeline
  guarantees is that the CV which gets rendered is the one the backend parsed out of
  the envelope, never a file an agent wrote behind it.
- **Additive:** the web is isolated from the core's packaging, CI and release
  automation. The CLI works exactly the same without it.

## Scheduled scans on Windows

Automatic recurring scans through Task Scheduler are Windows-only. On macOS and Linux,
saved scans run only when you choose **Run now** on the Scheduled scans page.
The web UI can save scan definitions without installing an OS task. To check and
run due jobs every 15 minutes, install the local worker from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File web/scripts/install-scan-schedule.ps1
```

Remove it with `web/scripts/uninstall-scan-schedule.ps1`. It runs in the current user's interactive session, so the user must be logged in. The task runs only
`web/scripts/scheduled-jobs-runner.mjs`; it never evaluates roles, applies, or invokes
an AI model. Job definitions and run history stay in the gitignored `data/`
directory.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server (Turbopack)
npm test             # unit suites (node --test, no framework)
npx tsc --noEmit     # typecheck
npm run build        # production build
```

Set `CAREER_OPS_ROOT=/path/to/checkout` in `web/.env.local` to point the app at
a different career-ops directory (useful for testing against sample data).
Root scripts such as `doctor.mjs` run from the checkout that holds `web/`, not
from `CAREER_OPS_ROOT`; set `CAREER_OPS_CODE_ROOT` when the app runs outside it.

Every route but build assets is gated by the same-origin + loopback guard in
`src/lib/origin-guard.mjs`. Two opt-ins widen it, both unset by default and both in `web/.env.local`:
`CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` names extra non-loopback hosts the dashboard may
answer on, and `CAREER_OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` names origins allowed to call the
API from outside the app — a comma- or space-separated list, no trailing slash.
The second is what a local companion client needs: a browser extension calls
from a `chrome-extension://` origin, which Fetch Metadata always reports as
`cross-site`, so the guard refuses it unless the id is named here. The host
layer still applies to an allowlisted origin.

Pass one-off flags through npm's `--`: `npm run dev -- -p 4000`.

### Exposing it beyond this machine

`CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is the list of hosts allowed to reach the
dashboard. Unset (or blank) the server binds `127.0.0.1`; name a host it cannot
already reach on loopback and the socket opens, with the guard answering for
loopback and the hosts you named:

```bash
CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS="192.168.1.50" npm run dev
```

It is not an on/off switch, and it is not read as one: `off`, `false`, `no` and
`0` are all valid hostnames, so treating them as words would have opened the
socket to the whole network for someone typing the word for "closed". They are
refused, as is anything else that cannot be read as a hostname or an IP address.
To stay on loopback, unset the variable.

`0.0.0.0` and `::` are refused too. They name every interface, which is a bind
target rather than a host anyone is addressed by: accepting one would open the
socket while the guard went on matching `Host` literally, so honest clients on
your network would get `403` and only a client spelling `Host: 0.0.0.0` would be
let in. To open it up, name the hosts that should reach it.

**How the bind is chosen.** Name a single IP address and the socket binds exactly
that address — `192.168.1.50` and nothing else. It has to be an address *this*
machine holds: naming the address of the laptop that should reach the dev box
makes the server fail to start with `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, since you can only listen on
your own interfaces. Name that laptop's *hostname* instead, or use a hostname for
the box, and the bind falls back to every interface. Link-local addresses
(`fe80::…`) are refused: they are ambiguous across interfaces and cannot be bound
without a zone index. Binding `0.0.0.0` for a single address would
also publish the dashboard on every other interface the machine has, a VPN tunnel
or a phone hotspot included, none of which you asked for. One socket carries one
address, so `http://localhost:3000` stops answering; open it at the address you
named. If you want loopback too, name a loopback host alongside
(`"192.168.1.50, localhost"`) — that binds `0.0.0.0` and accepts the wider
exposure deliberately. Anything else — a hostname, which needs a resolver the
launcher does not have, or two addresses, which cannot share a socket — binds
`0.0.0.0`. The startup line says which of these happened.

Naming only loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) is not an opt-in and
changes nothing — the guard already answers for those, so widening the socket
would expose every interface while granting no host that wasn't already allowed.

Set through `CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, neither layer can widen without the
other — the bind and the allow-list are derived from that one value. They are not
equivalent, and two things move them apart: the guard also answers for loopback,
which no bind address changes, and a `-H` of your own moves the bind while the
allow-list stays as it was (see below).

Understand what you are turning on. Once the socket is open, **everything the
dashboard serves — your CV, pipeline and reports — is reachable by anyone who can
both reach that port and satisfy the host filter**, and there is no login. Two
further caveats: a client that can reach the port can also supply its own `Host`
header, so on a widened bind the allow-list filters honest clients rather than
hostile ones; and a `0.0.0.0` bind is IPv4-only, so an opted-in IPv6 address will
pass the filter with nothing listening for it.

The guard covers page routes as well as `/api/*` (`src/proxy.ts`'s matcher spans
everything but build assets). That is not about the bind: a page you visit can
re-resolve its own domain to `127.0.0.1` and read the dashboard from your own
browser as same-origin, which a loopback bind does nothing to stop. The `Host`
header on that request carries the attacker's domain, which is what refuses it.

**In a container** the bind has to be `0.0.0.0` — loopback inside a network
namespace is not reachable from the host. Since `0.0.0.0` itself is refused as an
allowed host, get there by naming a *hostname* (the container's own name is the
obvious one): a hostname needs a resolver the launcher does not have, so the bind
falls back to every interface, which is what a namespace needs. A forwarded port
(`-p 3000:3000`) still arrives with `Host: localhost`, which
the guard admits, so the port publication is the whole of the access control
there: publish it on `127.0.0.1:3000:3000`, not `0.0.0.0`.

You can also override the bind directly — `npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0`. When you
pass `-H` or `--hostname`, the launcher injects nothing and Next resolves the
flag itself, so the startup line says the bind is Next's to choose rather than
claiming an address it would have to guess. **Prefer the env var.** An `-H` on
its own opens the socket while the allow-list stays empty, which is the one
combination with no honest reading: the guard then refuses LAN clients that
identify themselves truthfully and admits any that spell `Host: localhost`. The
launcher says so on startup rather than doing it quietly.

Use it on a network you trust, and prefer an SSH tunnel
(`ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 you@box`) where you can — that needs no env var at
all and keeps the bind on loopback.

### Tests

Suites live in `web/tests/`, mirroring the path of what they test under
`web/src/` — so `src/lib/clean-chips.mjs` is tested by
`tests/lib/clean-chips.test.mjs`. Name the file `{module}.test.mjs`.

Root-level scripts are the one exception: `server.mjs` is tested by
`tests/lib/server-launcher.test.mjs`, because `test-all.mjs`'s parity check gates
only `web/tests/lib/` and a suite outside it would never run in the required check.

`npm test` discovers them with a glob (`tests/**/*.test.mjs`), so a new suite
needs **no registration** — just add the file. **Requires Node ≥ 22**: earlier
versions don't expand CLI globs for `node --test`, so `npm test` prints
`Could not find '…'`, runs nothing and exits 1. Hence `engines.node` in
`web/package.json` — a higher floor than `next` itself asks for.

Three constraints follow from all this:

- **Keep tests out of `src/`.** `src/` is the Next.js app's own tree, scanned by
  `next build`'s file tracing and `tsc --noEmit`; test files there entangle
  fixtures with build and route conventions.
- **Use `.mjs`, not `.ts`.** There is no test framework and no TypeScript loader
  by design — `node --test` cannot run a `.ts` suite, so one would look like
  coverage and never execute. Extract the logic under test into a plain `.mjs`
  module (the pattern `src/lib/pdf-paths.mjs` and `src/lib/pdf-render.mjs`
  already follow) and import it from the test.
- **Web suites use `node:test`; core suites don't.** Here you write
  `import { test } from "node:test"` with `node:assert/strict`. The root
  `tests/` suite deliberately uses neither — it has its own `pass`/`fail`
  helpers, because [#1440](https://github.com/career-ops-hq/career-ops/issues/1440)
  requires the core suite to run on a bare clone with "no framework, not even
  `node:test`". Don't carry either style across the boundary.

`tests/web-test-layout.test.mjs` in the **root** suite enforces all of the above
on every PR, including that `npm test` never goes back to listing suites by name
([#2360](https://github.com/career-ops-hq/career-ops/issues/2360)).

### Assistant conversations

The assistant saves conversations in `.career-ops-web/chats/` under the resolved
user data root. New chat keeps the previous conversation; use the history picker
to switch, rename, or delete it. Clearing browser storage does not delete saved
conversations. The old `career-ops:chat` browser entry is migrated once and only
removed after its disk write succeeds. Empty greetings are not saved.

Writes are atomic and revision-checked: a stale tab cannot overwrite newer
messages. Save failures stay visible, and switching waits for the current save.
Files with invalid JSON are reported individually without blocking healthy
conversations; damaged files are never overwritten. A crashed
writer can leave a `.json.lock` file; after stopping the web server, remove that
lock and restart to retry. Conversation files contain personal text and should
stay local and gitignored. They are conversation history, not new verified CV
facts or a replacement for the canonical profile files.

Stored messages are not truncated. Model input is bounded to 24 recent messages
(up to 24,000 characters) plus literal excerpts of earlier user messages (up to
8,000 characters). Long excerpts may be shortened; this is not unlimited model
memory. Conversations are limited to 2,000 messages and 1 MB; a larger save is
rejected visibly without overwriting the previous file. On a save failure, export
the live conversation (including unsaved text) or explicitly confirm discarding
unsaved changes to start a new chat. Saved conversations remain on disk.
