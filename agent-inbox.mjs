/**
 * agent-inbox.mjs — a tiny bridge between *looking at* the pipeline and
 * *acting on* it.
 *
 * career-ops is driven from an AI session, but there's no durable place to drop
 * a request when you're not in one — e.g. while glancing at the tracker (or a
 * dashboard) you think "evaluate this URL" or "draft a follow-up for #7". This
 * is that place: an append-only queue the agent drains at the start of a
 * session.
 *
 *   data/agent-inbox.md
 *     - [ ] <stamp> — <request>          (pending)
 *     - [x] <stamp> — <request> → result: <one line>   (resolved)
 *
 * Fully local-first and human-in-the-loop: nothing here auto-submits. Queued
 * items are *intents* for the agent to action and the user to review. Markdown
 * checklist, no database, no server, no dependencies — edit it by hand or via
 * this CLI, and any tool (a dashboard, a script, cron) can append to it. The
 * protocol an agent follows is documented in modes/agent-inbox.md.
 *
 * Item numbers are *file positions*, not positions in the pending list: `add`
 * only ever appends, so a number never changes meaning once printed. `list`
 * therefore shows gaps as items get resolved (2, 4, 5) — the gaps are the
 * receipt that something was already handled, and a whole batch of resolves can
 * be read off a single `list` without drifting.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node agent-inbox.mjs add "evaluate https://acme.com/jobs/42"
 *   node agent-inbox.mjs list [--all]                 # pending only, or every item
 *   node agent-inbox.mjs resolve 1 [--expect "Acme"] [--result "scored 4.3 — report 012"]

  // running in the background can drop an item in — and a read-whole-file /
  // write-whole-file cycle loses every request that lands between the two. With
  // 30 concurrent `add` calls, half the queue vanished silently.
  //
  // POSIX guarantees an O_APPEND write is atomic below PIPE_BUF, and one
  // checklist line is far under it, so concurrent appends interleave instead of
  // clobbering. WINDOWS IS NOT POSIX, and that is the whole reason for the lock
  // below: with 30 concurrent adds on windows-latest this dropped exactly one
  // item (#2777), silently, which is the same failure this function exists to
  // remove — it just moved to the one platform the guarantee does not cover.
  //
  // The lock is the repo's existing one rather than a second mechanism: the
  // same `withPipelineLock` that scan.mjs uses for scan-history appends. Two
  // lock implementations would drift, and the append is short enough that
  // serializing it costs nothing next to spawning the process that calls it.
  //
  // Checking the last byte still happens INSIDE the lock: it decides whether a
  // separating newline is needed, and reading it outside would race with
  // another writer's append between the check and the write.
  //
  // timeoutMs is raised from the shared 8s default because this queue's whole
  // point is bursty concurrent writers (a dashboard, a script, cron all drop
  // items at once), and lock acquisition is a retry lottery, not a fair queue.
  // Serving N herded waiters is the coupon-collector problem: ~N·H(N) rounds,
  // so 30 concurrent adds need ~120 rounds while 8000/80 = 100 only affords
  // ~100. On the slow, contended windows-latest runner that shortfall makes one
  // waiter time out and its item is LOST, the exact #2777 drop, reappearing as
  // a loud LockTimeoutError instead of a silent overwrite. Jitter in
  // pipeline-lock.mjs cuts the collision rate ~6x but is explicitly "not a
  // cure"; the fit-for-purpose budget for a burst-write queue is the contained
  // fix. 30s gives ~375 rounds of headroom, well past the herd's worst case,
  // while the critical section itself is a single sub-millisecond append.
  //
  // ensureFile() is INSIDE the lock, not before it. Seeding the file is a
  // check-create-initialise sequence, and run unlocked it loses items the same
  // way the unlocked append did: a writer that observes the file between the
  // creator's open() and its write() sees a zero-byte file, appends into it,
  // and has its line overwritten when the header lands at offset 0. Every
  // writer exits 0 and the queue is left perfectly well-formed, one item
  // shorter — the silent drop the lock was added to end, one step earlier in
  // the same function.
  //
  // Holding the lock across the seed makes the window unreachable rather than
  // narrow: no writer can observe the file until the creator has released, and
  // the creator writes the header before it releases. 'wx' above stays as the
  // guard against writers that are not this function.
