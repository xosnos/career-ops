/**
 * scan-history-columns.mjs — the column layout of `scan-history.tsv`, and the
 * way to read a row by column name instead of by position.
 *
 * The file is positional and append-only. Every scanner appends one row per
 * posting it has seen; a column added later goes at the END of every newer
 * row, and rows written before it existed simply stop short. The header is
 * written only when the file is created and never rewritten, so an existing
 * file can carry an older, shorter header than its newest rows — or none at
 * all. That makes the order declared here, not the file's own header, the
 * authority on what each position means.
 *
 * What each column holds is documented in the Scan History table of
 * `modes/scan.md`. Adding a column: append its name to
 * {@link SCAN_HISTORY_COLUMNS}, fill it in the scanner's row writer
 * (`formatScanHistoryRow` in `scan.mjs`), and add a row to that table.
 *
 * Neither helper recognises the header row: its `url` cell is the literal
 * `url`, and callers skip it.
 *
 * Dependency-free, so any script can import it without loading the scanner.
 */

/**
 * The columns of `scan-history.tsv`, in file order — shared by the scanner's

 *

 * names never move. Readers that still index the file by position rely on
