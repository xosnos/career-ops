/**
 * Verify a tailored CV JSON payload preserves cv.md's structure — a
 * different class of bug than verify-cv-facts.mjs catches. That gate blocks
 * FABRICATION (a claim absent from the source); this one warns about silent
 * LOSS or REORDERING of what the source already has, which fabrication
 * checking has no way to see: an omitted company descriptor, a dropped
 * skills category, or an experience entry rendered out of chronological
 * order are all internally consistent with cv.md's own facts, just not
 * faithful to its structure.
 *
 * Non-blocking by design: the header shapes this understands
 * (`### Company {—|--|-} Location[ · descriptor]`) are common conventions,
 * not a system-wide cv.md spec, so a hard gate here would
 * enforce a habit nobody agreed to rather than a real contract. Findings
 * are surfaced as a warning the user reviews, not a failure that stops the
 * pipeline.
 *
 * Written 2026-08-24 after three same-day tailored CVs for different target
 * companies all silently dropped a company descriptor (a "· Series B
 * fintech"-style suffix), one also dropped the Languages skill category
 * and every education description, and all three swapped two experience
 * entries out of chronological order — none of which verify-cv-facts.mjs
 * is designed to catch, so all three PDFs passed that gate anyway.
 *
 * Understands `## Experience` and `## Work Experience` sections whose entry
 * headers use an em dash, double hyphen, or single hyphen between company and
 * location. These are common conventions, not a system-wide cv.md spec, so a
 * cv.md written another way parses to zero
 * entries — with nothing to compare against, this reports UNVERIFIED (exit 0)
 * rather than a false "passed", so a format mismatch warns instead of either
 * silently no-opping or blocking every user whose cv.md looks different.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node verify-cv-structure.mjs <payload.json> [--source cv.md]
 *   node verify-cv-structure.mjs --self-test
