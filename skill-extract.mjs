/**
 * skill-extract.mjs — the shared skill vocabulary + canonical extractor (#1896)
 *
 * Single source of truth for how career-ops recognizes and canonicalizes hard
 * skills. Lifted verbatim from upskill.mjs (the most-tested copy) so upskill,
 * jd-skill-gap, and analyze-patterns can converge on ONE vocabulary + canonical
 * form instead of three drifting ones — the drift class that shipped #1851
 * (CV "k8s" not suppressing JD "Kubernetes" is the same failure in jd-skill-gap).
 *
 * PR 1 of #1896 is a pure relocation: behavior is byte-identical to upskill's
 * former inline copy. `GO_SKILL_PATTERN` stays internal to extractSkills, and
 * canonicalize() passes unknown tokens through unchanged (no umbrella aliases —
 * "cloud" must never count as knowing AWS/GCP/Azure). Later PRs route
 * jd-skill-gap and analyze-patterns through this module.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free, so it's unit-testable without a tracker or network.
