// tests/updater-retired-path-prune.test.mjs — a path retired from the tree must
// stay in SYSTEM_PATHS until no supported install can still be carrying it.
//
// `apply()` deletes files that upstream has removed via `staleSystemFiles`,
// which only considers a local file that is BOTH absent from the remote tree
// AND matched by a SYSTEM_PATHS entry (`pathMatchesManifest`). So the manifest
// entry is what gives the prune its reach, and removing the entry in the same
// change that deletes the file is precisely backwards: the file stops shipping
// to new installs and becomes permanent on existing ones.
//
// #3765 hit this. Moving four root suites into tests/ made their SYSTEM_PATHS
// entries look redundant — `tests/` already covers the destination — so they
// were dropped. Probed against the production function, that left an upgrading
// install holding all four forever, where tests/root-tests-registration.test.mjs
// reports them as unregistered suites and turns a healthy install's
// `node test-all.mjs` red. Found in review by @nikitacometa.
