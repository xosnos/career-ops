// tests/archive-posting-non-content.test.mjs — archiveUrl() refuses to save a
// non-content capture (login wall / 404 shell / paywall / JS-required /
// bot-challenge) rather than silently reporting success (#4526) — while a
// real, long posting that merely CARRIES one of those phrases incidentally
// (a sidebar sign-in nudge next to a full JD) is still archived normally,
// since the marker check is gated on the page being short overall.
//
// check-jd-archive.mjs's detectNonContentMarker() already recognizes these
// shapes, but only at AUDIT time — well after a bad capture is already sitting
// in jds/. This exercises the REAL archiveUrl() (no mocking of the detection
// logic itself), driven through a fake Playwright browser/context/page rather
// than a real one: archive-posting.mjs has no dedicated test suite of its own
// anywhere in this repo, precisely because it does real network navigation
// through a real headless browser, and a unit test that launched Chromium
// against a live URL would be flaky, slow, and network-dependent for no
// benefit. The fake page satisfies exactly the Playwright surface
// archiveUrl() calls (goto/url/title/$eval/waitForTimeout/evaluate/pdf) so the
// REAL function logic runs end to end; only the browser layer underneath it
// is faked. CAREER_OPS_ROOT is set to a temp dir BEFORE import, so JDS_DIR
// resolves there instead of the real project's jds/.
//
