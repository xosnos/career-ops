 * and then asks about index membership, which is a different question.
 *
 * The pins below are the reason this is shared rather than copied, but they are
 * not all load-bearing for both callers, and this docstring should not imply
 * otherwise. Mutation-tested by dropping each pin under a GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL it
 * exists to neutralise:
 *
 *   - `commit.gpgsign=false` and `core.hooksPath` → an empty dir. Either one
 *     inherited from the environment breaks every commit the fixtures make.
 *     Dropping either reddens BOTH suites.
 *   - `core.excludesFile` → an empty file. A global ignore rule silently alters
 *     what is measured (the failure mode reported in #2269). Dropping it reddens
 *     updater-add-paths only: updater-is-tracked writes its own .gitignore and
 *     then reads index membership, which a global rule does not move. Kept for
 *     both as a defensive pin, proven by one.
 *
 * Point `core.excludesFile` at an empty file rather than /dev/null: git on
 * Windows maps that to `nul` and dies with "fatal: cannot use nul as an
 * exclude file".
 *
 * Kept as one body so a pin cannot be dropped from one caller while the other
 * keeps it — which is the drift CodeRabbit flagged on #2531, where two copies
 * meant a pin added to one left the other silently unprotected. Note that is a
 * weaker guarantee than "deleting a pin fails both suites", which the table
 * above shows is only true for two of the three.
 *
 * The two other `makeRepo` fixtures under tests/ are deliberately NOT folded in
 * here: `updater-local-system-edits` pins line endings instead of excludes and
 * seeds a base commit plus an `upstream` branch, and `updater-rollback-behavior`
 * pins nothing. They are different fixtures that share a name, not copies of
 * this one.
 *
 * The pins above are the FILE layer. They do not hold against the runtime layer:
 * an ambient GIT_CONFIG_COUNT pair is applied after every config file, so a
 * `core.excludesFile` injected that way overrode the one pinned here, the seed
 * file was never staged, and the base commit died before the first assertion
 * (#3801). So the fixture runs git through `hermeticGitRunner` rather than
 * through the updater's own `gitIn`, which inherits the environment as a real
 * install must. That also keeps this module on Node builtins alone: most suites
 * import it, and none of them should pull in update-system.mjs as a side effect
 * of asking for `pass`/`fail`.
 *
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {string} [options.prefix='co-updater-'] - mkdtemp prefix, so a leftover
 *   temp dir names the suite that made it.
 * @param {boolean} [options.includeRoot=false] - Add `root` to the returned ctx.

 * asking a proxy whether the shell is elevated. A proxy is the wrong tool here.
 * A restricted token still lists the Administrators SID in `whoami /groups`
 * (present for deny only), and inside one elevated token PowerShell's

 * and "can still write" are genuinely different questions.
 *
 * Fails toward RUNNING the assertion: if the probe cannot be arranged at all

 *
 * Lives here rather than in each suite because the two copies of this setup
